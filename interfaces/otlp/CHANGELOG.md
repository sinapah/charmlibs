## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release of charmlibs.interfaces.otlp
- `OtlpRequirer` for consuming OTLP endpoints from a provider relation
- `OtlpProvider` for publishing OTLP endpoints to requirer relations
- `OtlpEndpoint` pydantic model representing a single OTLP endpoint (protocol, URL, telemetries); used to communicate the required information for a server offering an OTLP API endpoint
- Support for filtering endpoints by protocol (`http`, `grpc`) and telemetry type (`logs`, `metrics`, `traces`)
- `gRPC` is favoured over `HTTP` when multiple endpoints are available
- Support for publishing LogQL and PromQL rules via `OtlpRequirer.publish()`
- LZMA+base64 compression of rules in the requirer databag to avoid Juju databag size limits
- `OtlpProvider.rules()` for fetching rules from all requirer relations with injected Juju topology and validation 
- Generic aggregator rules automatically included in every requirer's published rule set
- Python 3.10+ compatibility
